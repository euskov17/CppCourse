She works at school. My brother is little. He doesn't go to school. He goes to a kindergarten. He is four.
I like to play. I have got many toys. I have got a teddy-bear, dolls, a ball, a toy monkey and a doll's house. I like the doll's house very much. It is big. It is pink and nice.
We have got a cat. It is small and grey. It is very nice. It has big blue eyes, a funny nose, a small mouth and sharp teeth. Its ears are small. It can play hide-and-seek. I love my cat. It loves me, too.
I go to school. I'm a pupil. I have got many friends. We have our classroom. It is nice and large. You can see twelve desks, many chairs, our teacher's table, a blackboard, two bookcases in the classroom. At the lessons we have pens, pencils, pencil-boxes or pencil-cases, rulers, erasers, textbooks, exercise-books, record-books on the desks.
I like to read. I can read well. I like fairytales. They are very interesting. I like «Cinderella» and «Pinocchio» best.

The Philadelphia into which Frank Algernon Cowperwood was born was a city of two hundred and fifty thousand and more. It was set with handsome parks, notable buildings, and crowded with historic memories.
Many of the things that we and he knew later were not then in existence — the telegraph, telephone, express company, ocean steamer, city delivery of mails.
There were no postage-stamps or registered letters.
The street car had not arrived.
In its place were hosts of omnibuses, and for longer travel the slowly developing railroad system still largely connected by canals.
↺
Cowperwood's father was a bank clerk at the time of Frank's birth, but ten years later, when the boy was already beginning to turn a very sensible, vigorous eye on the world, Mr. Henry Worthington Cowperwood, because of the death of the bank's president and the consequent moving ahead of the other officers, fell heir to the place vacated by the promoted teller, at the, to him, munificent salary of thirty-five hundred dollars a year.
At once he decided, as he told his wife joyously, to remove his family from 21 Buttonwood Street to 124 New Market Street, a much better neighborhood, where there was a nice brick house of three stories in height as opposed to their present two-storied domicile.
There was the probability that some day they would come into something even better, but for the present this was sufficient.
He was exceedingly grateful.
Henry Worthington Cowperwood was a man who believed only what he saw and was content to be what he was — a banker, or a prospective one.
He was at this time a significant figure — tall, lean, inquisitorial, clerkly — with nice, smooth, closely-cropped side whiskers coming to almost the lower lobes of his ears.
His upper lip was smooth and curiously long, and he had a long, straight nose and a chin that tended to be pointed.
↺
His eyebrows were bushy, emphasizing vague, grayish-green eyes, and his hair was short and smooth and nicely parted.
He wore a frock-coat always — it was quite the thing in financial circles in those days — and a high hat.
And he kept his hands and nails immaculately clean.
His manner might have been called severe, though really it was more cultivated than austere.
Being ambitious to get ahead socially and financially, he was very careful of whom or with whom he talked.
He was as much afraid of expressing a rabid or unpopular political or social opinion as he was of being seen with an evil character, though he had really no opinion of great political significance to express.
↺
He was neither anti- nor pro-slavery, though the air was stormy with abo
